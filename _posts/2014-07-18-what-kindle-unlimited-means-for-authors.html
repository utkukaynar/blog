    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nNow that Amazon has uncorked their Kindle Unlimited
    service I, like many indie authors, was curious. What does this mean for us withered
    scribes, scribbling away in our garrets and bobbing on the waves of Amazon's massive
    literary marketplace? Will I get paid if I join Kindle Unlimited? How do I add
    my book to the mix? Will I become fabulously rich?\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I've
    been mucking about with indie publishing for a year now with the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/mytro-project\">Mytro
    Project</a> and, with enough digging, you will find one or more of my books on
    Amazon.\r\n\r\nWith that said, let's address our scrivenarial concerns.\r\n\r\n<b>￼Will
    I get paid if I join Kindle Unlimited?</b> I have asked Amazon for more specifics
    on how royalties work in Kindle Unlimited but what appears to be happening is
    that they are treating Kindle Unlimited books as part of their Kindle Direct Publishing
    Select Program. KDP Select is a part of Kindle Direct Publishing system that allows
    you to upload and publish books in a few minutes. I've <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/04/pressing-the-button/\">written
    about it here</a>.\r\n\r\nThe KDP Select Program is a special service offered
    to indie writers <i>who agree not to make their books available elsewhere</i>.
    It's a very mercenary concept on Amazon's part but allows you to offer your book
    for free for a limited time and support pre-orders. But woe betide you if you
    upload your book elsewhere. The moment Amazon's robots find your book on, say,
    Barnes &amp; Noble, all that largesse is over.\r\n\r\nSo how do you get paid?
    KU will supply limited royalties from something called the KDP Select Global Fund.
    Readers must read 10% of the book to be eligible for royalties that will change
    from month to month. Here is the exact Amazon language:\r\n<div style=\"margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px
    solid #ccc;font-style:italic;\">￼\r\nThe fund amount is variable and announced
    on a monthly basis. We constantly monitor all factors that impact the KDP Select
    fund in order to set the fund amount for our KDP Select authors.\r\n...Earn your
    share of the KDP Select Global Fund amount when readers chose and read more than
    10% of your book from Kindle Unlimited, or borrow your book from the Kindle Owners’
    Lending Library.</div>\r\nIn other words, if someone grabs your book on KU you
    will receive a small amount from a fund set up by Amazon itself - and that's only
    if they read ten percent of your book.\r\n\r\nWhat does this look like in practice?
    You can see the KU line on my KDP report. You'll also notice that the \"Free\"
    books are separate from KU books.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1031520\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nSince I'm not part of KDP Select, I'm out of luck.
    I suspect Amazon has signed a number of deals to get so-called Big 5 titles on
    the service as well.\r\n\r\n<b>￼How do I add my book to the mix?</b> This is still
    unclear. I didn't notice a distinct \"add to KU\" button on the KDP dashboard
    but that could be because I've opted out of KDP Select (for a few reasons, but
    mostly because I wanted to experiment with the Nook, iBooks, and Kobo stores)
    so I don't get any of Amazon's benevolence. Enrolling in KDP Select is, arguably,
    a tough pill to swallow unless you truly and endlessly love Amazon.\r\n\r\n<strong>Will
    I become fabulously rich?</strong> I doubt it. But maybe someone will read your
    book, like it, and buy a million copies. An ink-stained wretch can dream.</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:2;}"
