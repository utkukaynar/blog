    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nWhy, on a philosophical level, has Facebook been
    so staggeringly successful? A startup that swelled into a multi billion dollar
    revenue generating business in a relatively short span of years, one which <a
    href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/28/facebook-q3-2014/\">continues to attract
    billions of users</a> every month?\r\n\r\nAccording to writer and philosopher
    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/alaindebotton\">Alain de Botton</a> the
    company's success can be explained by the fact it tapped into a genuine human
    need that was being overlooked and underserved by the rest of the business community:
    the desire to have better relationships.\r\n\r\nWhether Facebook is actually serving
    that need <em>well</em> is a whole other question, but the appetite it taps into
    is undeniable. And de Botton argues that other core human needs continue to be
    drastically underserved by the modern business community -- providing a fertile
    opportunity for startups to fashion and forge businesses that are successful exactly because
    they serve the goal of increasing our wellbeing.\r\n\r\nHe was making the comments
    in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/the-virtues-of-modern-business/\">talk
    on the virtues of modern business</a> last week, at London's <a target=\"_blank\"
    href=\"http://bigideas.inmidtown.org/\">Midtown Big Ideas Exchange</a> -- beginning
    with the premise that we need a better, more virtuous version of capitalism. Not
    that capitalism itself is broken, with de Botton professing himself a capitalist
    with caveats, but that the current version is misguided and misdirected -- with
    businesses all too often created to fix problems that are, as he put it, \"nonsense\"
    or \"bullshit\". Rather than addressing areas of genuine human psychological need.\r\n\r\nNo
    one in a developed economy can argue that selling bullshit is going to increase
    the sum total of human happiness. Not even in a mercenary sense -- because, as
    de Botton pointed out, after a certain income threshold, rising wealth is not
    a psychological accelerator to happiness.\r\n\r\n\"How are we going to go about
    creating a better version of business -- a better version of capitalism?\" he
    began, dubbing this \"one of the most pressing issues of our time\" given its
    contribution to social unrest and human unhappiness. \"Capitalism has taken a
    real bashing over the last few years, is in deep trouble as a concept, assailed
    from all sides. Where we're aiming to get to is a good version of business, a
    good better version of capitalism.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to try and make headway
    because if we don't make headway the mob will. We live in a world that's dominated
    by social media. By instantaneous, mob, collective reactions to things and unless
    businesses, and people involved in business understand a little bit more about what
    they're doing, and what they should be doing, and what they should be defending,
    and what they should be changing the system will be in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n(Entrepreneur
    Nick Hanauer expressed similar sentiments about the need to address capitalism's
    rising inequalities in a recent article for Politico, called <a target=\"_blank\"
    href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/the-pitchforks-are-coming-for-us-plutocrats-108014.html#.VFTyT2QllhM\">The
    Pitchforks Are Coming... For Us Plutocrats</a>.)\r\n\r\n\"Many economists have
    noted in the past few years ever since Richard Layard's landmark studies on happiness,
    we have recognized that increases in happiness do not directly follow from increases
    in national income. That a country can get ever richer and people are not happier.
    The magic figure is $36,000, above $36,000 increases in income do not translate
    very easily into any increases in happiness,\" he added.\r\n\r\nde Botton went
    on to define human need as the core things that are elemental to our psychological
    wellbeing. And which are absolutely distinct from \"vain desires\" -- aka passing
    fancies or things we wish for \"in an idle way\". Things which we are all too
    often induced to wish for by the snake oil of the advertising industry.\r\n[tc_writerquote]\"More
    of the economy needs to further up Maslow’s pyramid.[/tc_writerquote]\r\nHence
    the misdirection of much of modern capitalism -- since it's pouring its energies
    into coming up with ever more clever ways to sell us things we don't need, rather
    than applying intellect to figure out what we really need and selling us that
    instead.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is an absolutely fundamental basic philosophical
    distinction -- that distinction between needs and desires. So needs are the things
    you really need, and desires are the things you think you need but in fact you
    don't really, you only wish for them in an idle way,\" said de Botton.\r\n\r\nHe referred
    to the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, saying his recipe for human happiness
    amounted to an individual being able to gain three core things: community/friendship,
    the chance to be independent, and the chance to think continuously about an inner
    life in order to reduce personal anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Those who oppose business,
    those who say businesses corrupt, they latch onto something absolutely key. They
    will say that businesses are not satisfying our real needs, they are merely exciting
    us to vain desires. We don't really need to go gambling, we don't really need
    to go bowling, we don't really need to eat greasy, unhealthy food, but we can
    be excited to do so with certain inducements and therefore business is evil; business
    it not virtuous because it is not properly satisfying people's needs,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And
    because this is undoubtedly true that some organizations are satisfying vain needs
    and not real needs, this has cast a cloud over all business and it's slightly
    muddled the perception of everyone working within capitalism.\"\r\n\r\nBut --
    crucially -- it does not have to be this way, argued de Botton. And Facebook's
    success in building a business that at least started out trying to address a real
    human need shows the huge untapped potential for startups that opt to \"run a
    virtuous business\" by seeking to fix genuine human problems.\r\n\r\nWhat then
    is the recipe for following in Facebook's footsteps and building a business along
    de Botton's more virtuous, capitalist lines?\r\n\r\n\"You just have to start with
    human need. What is it that really makes people happy?\" he said, adding that
    an area of particular interest for him is relationships. \"How we relate to others.
    The single greatest contributor to people's wellbeing is what sort of relationships
    are they in. And we are hopeless at relationships.\"\r\n\r\nHe cited statistics
    that half of marriages fail, and that not only that but of the half of couples
    that stay together 40 per cent have thought of leaving their partner more than
    one in the previous month. \"We need to think about this area. It should be a
    major area of the economy. It should be a bigger area of the economy than running
    shoes,\" argued de Botton.\r\n\r\n\"Think of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow's
    famous pyramid of needs</a>, at the bottom you've got material needs, as you climb
    up towards self actualization, meaning, friendship, connection etc. I would simply
    say that more of the economy needs to further up Maslow's pyramid. I think that's
    happening anyway -- the fact that Facebook's now one of the most important companies
    in the world. I don't think it's doing it that well, but it's further up the tree
    than an oil company. It's further up the pyramid of needs.\r\n\r\n\"And I think
    this is going to be the direction as neuroscience makes advances, as we enter
    into a more psychological century, and as we realize that we're still only at
    the beginning of capitalism. It looks like we've got everything. It looks like
    Apple's invented every gadget but there's so much that still needs to be done,
    the economy still has so much to grow for.\"\r\n\r\nOne area de Botton singled
    out as ripe for far more better businesses to be created is matching human talents
    to jobs. A mismatch in our skills and careers is the cause of much modern misery,
    he argued, saying far more innovation is needed here.\r\n\r\n\"Most of us are
    still trapped in the cage that was chosen for us by our 17-year-old selves and
    we can't get out of it because we are still at the dawn of really trying to understand
    how to match people with jobs which properly fit their talents,\" he said. \"One
    resource we waste inordinate amounts of all the time is human talent. We are still
    not matching talent properly.\"\r\n\r\nTalking generally about opportunities that
    entrepreneurs can capitalize on within a more virtuous model of capitalism, de
    Botton suggested even something as basic as making a list of things that make
    you unhappy could offer the germ of a business idea.\r\n\r\n\"There is a back
    to basics view that suggests that capitalism is sort of running out of steam because
    we've got everything that we need... I think that's completely wrong. The world
    economy will only, as it were, have done its job when everything is perfect. So
    long as you walk down the road and one paving stone is slightly misaligned, so
    long as you're look at a building and one tile is a little bit out of place, so
    long as there's something you want and no one is quite selling it to you, so long
    as there's an area of your life that's a little bit unhappy and someone is not
    selling you a service to fix it the economy is not large enough, there is still
    unemployment that has no proper basis.\r\n\r\n\"In other words there is a lot
    of need out there that is not yet being satisfied. I think we should and can have
    full employment if we focus on allocating our resources properly.\"\r\n\r\nUnemployment
    is a consequence of \"the wrong perception of what should be commercialized\",
    he argued, adding: \"We haven't begun to scratch the surface of human unhappiness.
    Every bit of human unhappiness is a business waiting to be born. Some people say
    what business should I do, what business should I go into? And I always say are
    you unhappy about anything in your life? Make a list of everything you're unhappy
    about -- from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep, in an average
    day.  Everything you write down is a business.\r\n\r\n\"There are so many needs
    which we haven't yet learned to satisfy and a full economy will be one which properly
    delivers happiness across so many areas. At the moment we are just scratching
    the surface. We have managed to satisfy people's basic material needs... but we're
    unhappy, we're squabbling, we're looking for meaning. These are all businesses
    waiting to be born. Waiting for the ingenuity of entrepreneurs to harness human
    unhappiness and connect it up to profit.\r\n\r\n\"It's only been done in a relatively
    narrow range of human activities. Running shoes, got lots of those. Pizzas, got
    lots of those. One of the largest businesses in the world should be psychotherapy.
    Given the contribution that psychotherapy can make it should be worth a hundred
    times more than BMW,\" he added.\r\n[tc_writerquote]Until Facebook came along
    we didn’t know how lonely we were.[/tc_writerquote]\r\nAnd while de Botton conceded
    it may be \"on the whole a little bit harder to make money from genuine needs
    than vain desires\", he argued the potential rewards are worth the extra effort
    -- given the contribution more virtuous businesses can make to those who build
    them and the people the businesses serve. And given the risks associated with
    doing nothing to fix the model of capitalism we have now.\r\n\r\n\"Until Facebook
    came along we didn't know how lonely we were. Or how much we wanted to connect
    with other people. We didn't even know it was a need, we didn't know it was a
    business. That need to send people messages all the time about more or less nothing
    -- we didn't know that was a need. That's what businesses do, they latch on to
    our needs and there is an enormous area of opportunity waiting to be discovered.\"\r\n\r\nIn
    the talk de Botton also discussed philosopher and economist Adam Smith's idea
    of the need to incentivize the very wealthy -- the richest entrepreneurs who have
    already amassed their fortunes -- to make more socially beneficial contributions.
    The problem, he argued, boils down to society using the shorthand of wealth to
    \"keep score\" on individual worth, which encourages the super rich to amass more
    wealth instead of looking for ways to use that wealth to help society at large.\r\n\r\n\"We
    don't honor people who do the right thing enough... The incentive structure is
    not there. There's occasional reward but there is no reliable system of reward
    pegged to doing good in the world. And that's why more people don't do good. Because
    it's literally irrational,\" argued de Botton. \"We need to understand human vanity.
    We need to understand the mechanisms by which love, respect, honor can be aligned
    with socially beneficial goals. It absolutely isn't at the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've
    got a very dangerous value system which rewards things it shouldn't be rewarding,\"
    he added. \"But the useful thing is the rich don't want money they want love.
    Therefore a good society takes that and does very interesting things with it.\"</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"
