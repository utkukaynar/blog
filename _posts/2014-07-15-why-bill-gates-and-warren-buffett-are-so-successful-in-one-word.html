    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nWhen Bill Gates first met Warren Buffett, their
    host at dinner, Gates’ mother, asked everyone around the table to identify what
    they believed was the single most important factor in their success through life.
    Gates and Buffett gave the same one-word answer: “Focus.” (See more in <em>The
    Snowball</em> by Alice Schroeder).\r\n\r\nI love the clarity of their answer but
    I am also concerned by how this can be, to quote Rudyard Kipling, “twisted by
    knaves to make a trap for fools.” I am an advocate for focus in work, life and
    leadership. However, the subject has a nuance and depth that many people miss.
    For a start, most people think of there only being one kind of focus.\r\n<h2>Focus
    as a noun</h2>\r\nWhen people speak of focus they usually mean having a single
    goal. It is a static thing, a thing you <em>have</em>. This kind of focus conjures
    pictures of Roger Bannister relentlessly pursuing his goal of breaking the four-minute
    mile, John F. Kennedy challenging NASA to put a man on the moon within a decade
    or, coming back to Bill Gates, a vision of a personal computer on every desk.
    The upside to this kind of focus is clear and compelling: you pursue a single
    objective and don’t get distracted along the way; you build momentum as many different
    people aligned behind achieving this one goal.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a dark
    side to focus as a noun. It’s what we might think of as the Kodak Problem. Kodak
    was relentlessly focused on a single objective—and it almost killed them. They
    found themselves caught off guard by the disruptive innovation of digital cameras.
    Kodak was so focused on optimizing for traditional film capture and processing
    that they did not see or accept the transformation in their industry. This is
    where the second type of focus comes in.\r\n<h2>Focus as a verb</h2>\r\nFocus
    is not just something you <em>have</em> it is also something you <em>do</em>.
    This type of focus is not static; it is an intense, dynamic, ongoing, iterative
    process. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Steve Jobs saying to Jony Ive
    day after day, “This might be crazy, but what if we…” until once in a while the
    idea took the air out of the room. It’s the constant exploration needed to see
    what is really going on and what the “noun focus” should be.\r\n\r\nImagine if
    the moment you woke up this morning your eyes focused one time and then never
    adjusted again. You would be out of focus all day. Our eyes produce clarity through
    a perpetual process of adjustment. Similarly, in our lives and on our teams, it
    is not enough to say, “We have our focus!” Rather, and adapting Dwight D. Eisenhower
    statement, “Focus is nothing, focusing is everything.” That may take the point
    too far, but it still makes the point that having a focus is insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe
    downside to thinking of focus as a verb only, is that it can lead to being overly
    reactive. It can lead people to making and remaking decisions too fast for any
    real momentum to take place. It can result in counterfeit agility where things
    feel fast but people aren’t going forward. It can become motion sickness instead
    of momentum.\r\n\r\nThe answer is to develop and value both types of focus. Professor
    Henry Mintzberg taught that there are two sources of strategy:\r\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Deliberate strategy</strong>,
    where leaders develop a clear vision and map this to long, medium and short term
    goals (focus as a noun);</li>\r\n\t<li>\n<strong>emergent strategy</strong>, where
    people respond to unanticipated problems and opportunities (focus as a verb).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIt
    is the disciplined pursuit of both of these approaches that best enables us to
    focus on what is essential. We can plot this on a two by two to see what is at
    stake.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-231910\" src=\"http://utkukaynarblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2.jpg\"

    data-rehosted=\"1\">\r\n\r\nHere are three ways to combine both types of focus
    to ensure we getting the vital few things done.\r\n<h2>Ask the right questions</h2>\r\nBill
    Gates said of Warren Buffett,<em> “</em>I first met him… at a dinner my mother
    had put together. On my way there, I thought, ‘Why would I want to meet this guy
    who picks stocks?’ I thought he just used various market-related things—like volume,
    or how the price had changed over time—to make his decisions. But when we started
    talking that day, he didn’t ask me about any of those things. Instead he started
    asking big questions about the fundamentals of our business. ‘Why can’t IBM do
    what Microsoft does? Why has Microsoft been so profitable?’ That’s when I realized
    he thought about business in a much more profound way than I’d given him credit
    for.”\r\n\r\nIn order to have focus we need to escape to focus. As I wrote in <em><a
    href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-The-Disciplined-Pursuit-Less/dp/0804137382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400517057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=essentialism+the+disciplined+pursuit+of+less\"
    target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essentialism</a>, “</em>I once attended a question-and-answer
    session with Bill at the headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
    in Seattle, Washington. By chance he had just completed his latest ‘Think Week.’
    Though I had heard about this practice, what I didn’t know was that it goes all
    the way back to the 1980s and that he stuck to it through the height of Micro-
    soft’s expansion. In other words, twice a year, during the busiest and most frenetic
    time in the company’s history, he still created time and space to seclude himself
    for a week and do nothing but read articles (his record is 112) and books, study
    technology, and think about the bigger picture. Today he still takes the time
    away from the daily distractions of running his foundation to simply think. Whether
    you can invest two hours a day, two weeks a year, or even just five minutes every
    morning, it is important to make space to escape in your busy life.\"\r\n<h2>Know
    how valuable your time is</h2>\r\nAs Bill Gates has written, “No matter how much
    money you have, you can’t buy more time. There are only 24 hours in everyone’s
    day. Warren has a keen sense of this. He doesn’t let his calendar get filled up
    with useless meetings. On the other hand, he’s very generous with his time for
    the people he trusts. He gives his close advisers at Berkshire his phone number,
    and they can just call him up and he’ll answer the phone.”\r\n\r\nFocusing on
    what is essential is a powerful ability, perhaps the most powerful in a world
    where we are so bombarded with distracting ideas, information and opinions. However,
    if we want to consistently give our energies to what is essential we need to develop both kinds
    of focus. Only in this way can we answer with confidence the question, “What’s
    important now?”\r\n\r\n<em>This post originally appeared at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140707144749-8353952-the-one-word-answer-to-why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-have-been-so-successful?trk=mp-reader-card\">LinkedIn</a>.
